SUMMER SCHOOL TRIP: SCIENCE MUSEUM

Dear Parents,
We are excited to go on a trip to the Science Museum in the city center. The bus will leave from the school gate on Monday, June 1st at 8:00 AM. We will return to the school by 3:30 PM on the same day.

WHAT TO BRING:
- The cost of the trip is $15 per student.
- Please bring a packed lunch from home. The museum cafe is currently closed.
- Students must wear their blue school uniform so we can stay together.

GOAL:
The goal is to learn about space and the planets. This trip is part of our science class. We hope every student can join us for this fun day of learning!
