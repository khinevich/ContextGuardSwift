TRIP UPDATE: WATER PARK ADVENTURE

Hi Class,
Here is the final plan for our big trip to the Water Park at the beach! The train leaves from the station on Wednesday, June 3rd at 10:00 AM. We will get back to the school very late, around 7:00 PM.

COST AND FOOD:
- The price is $30 for each person. This includes your ticket and a locker.
- You do not need to bring food. We will all eat lunch together at the park restaurant. The meal is included in the price.

CLOTHING:
- Please wear your favorite swimming clothes and a bright t-shirt.
- Do not wear your school uniform because it will get wet and messy.
